# BookCat

**An android application for organising a personal book collection**

Developed a mobile app for Android as part of my final year studies in a BSc in Computing and Internet Technologies. The project allows users to enter an ISBN number into a text field, which is then used to query the Google Books API to get the book cover, title and author.
